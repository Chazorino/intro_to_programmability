# Setup for Computer for Programmability

This series so far has used the online editor at [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3). While this is convenient we might want to have our own local development environment that we can use for our projects. 

In this additional series we will cover how to setup your windows, Mac or Linux system 
for development with the python programming language. 

We will install:

* **The python interpreter** so that you can run python programs
* **Essential python packages**
* **Postman** to interact with and try out REST APIs in a graphical interface
* **Visual Studio Code** as an editor with code highlighting and auto-complete functionality

Below you can find links to the guide for your operating system.

* [Setup your Windows for Programmability](windows.md)
* [Setup your Linux for Programmability](linux.md)
