# Our Project for today

As our first little python project we are going to build a small todo manager app. 

The requirements and functionalities of our app are as follows:

* Allows the user to create, list and mark as done todo items
* A todo item has a title, id and priority
* Todos are stored as json files in a `todos/` directory
* Each of the core functionalities (create, list, mark as done) are implemented as functions
* Creating a new todo item will create a new file in the `todos/` directory
* Listing todo items will list all files in the `todos/` directory
* Marking a todo item as done will delete the file in the `todos` directory

Let's get started!
