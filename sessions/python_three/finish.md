# That's It!

Congratulations! You wrote your first little application in python. Feel free to expand on this
example. Functionality you could add includes

* Checking that the id really does not exist when creating a new todo item
* Providing a function to update a existing todo item
* Allow different types of fields
* Check that a todo item with a provided id actually exists when deleting a item
