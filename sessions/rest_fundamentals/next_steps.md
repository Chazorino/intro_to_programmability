# Next Steps

So what's next? Now that you have a overview of what's possible with APIs we encourage you to explore on your own. 

First, you'll need to setup your computer for development. Cisco DevNet provides a step-by-step guide on how to do this for all platforms:

* [Setup for Windows](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/devnet-express/devnet-express-meraki/dev-setup/dev-win/step/1)
* [Setup for Mac](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/devnet-express/devnet-express-meraki/dev-setup/dev-mac/step/1)
* [Setup for Linux (CentOS)](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/devnet-express/devnet-express-meraki/dev-setup/dev-centos/step/1)
* [Setup for Linux (Ubuntu)](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/devnet-express/devnet-express-meraki/dev-setup/dev-ubuntu/step/1)

In the coming weeks of this PIW we will now go ahead and cover use cases for each of our architectures as well as technical introductory sessions that will train you on the specific APIs for those products.
